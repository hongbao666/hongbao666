I have to finish reading a book and give a report next Monday.
Annie:That doesn&apos;t sound too bad.
Jack:But I&apos;m a very slow reader.
Annie:Just read quickly to get the main ideas at first. Don&apos;t read word by word. Read word groups.
Jack:But I don&apos;t understand many of the words. I have to use a dictionary.
Annie:Try to guess a word&apos;s meaning by reading the sentences before ancl after it You probably understand more than you think.
Jack:That sounds difficult !
Annie:Well, be patient. It takes time. You can become better by reading something you enjoy every day. The more you read, the faster you&apos;ll be.
